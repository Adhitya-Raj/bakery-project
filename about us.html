<p><center>Hi! Thanks for stopping by! Here's a little bit about me, I'll keep it short and simple.

I love to cook and bake and take novice photographs of all my tasty creations so I can share it with all of you (I need some way
to use the 30 photos of an Oreo cupcake at every possible angle). I've been food blogging for a few years now and I'm just
starting to get the hang of it. I have two great little girls and an adventurous little boy. I do cardio out of necessity and try
to sneak healthy snacks and meals in when I can. I actually have a fairly decent repertoire of healthy and tasty recipes I make
often, but sweets are more fun and satisfying! No one's eyes get big when you put a lean ground turkey meatloaf in front of them.
 But! present them with a triple-layer coconut cake filled and topped with strawberries and covered in a delicious
frosting bathed in coconut, and then you see why baking is so rewarding!

Hopefully you'll find some enticing and delicious recipes here and come back often for more tasty treats and dishes. I love to hear
from you, so don't be shy!

Cheers!</center></p></td>

<center><p>Co-founders Shiva and Akila, met in 2008 while Shiva was visiting Delhi. The two bonded over their love of animals and passion for eating a plant-based diet. She fell in love with his accent; he fell in love with her baking, and with a little help from friends and family, Bake-a-Holic was born.</p>

<p>The couple opened the first Bake-a-Holic bakery in Chennai, India in 2010. In 2014, the pair appeared on Vijay’s hit television show, The Wall. After the show, they adopted a franchise business model, and began expanding Bake-a-Holic locations in TamilNadu.</p>

<p>Shiva and Akila believe that everyone has the power to make a positive change in this world. Learn more about the Bake-a-Holic mission, and why our products are 100% vegan.</p>
